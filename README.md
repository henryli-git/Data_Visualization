# Data Visualization

This repository contains graphs of various csv data sets and associated python files. 

## Prerequisites

Remember to check if you have the proper python modules installed before running the script for each graph.  Python 3.6 or later must also be used because some scripts contain f-strings. 

## Acknowledgments
